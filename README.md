This is the original discord bot I created in C#. Its the full code, and only usernames, passwords, IPs, ports, and the like have been stripped. I hope it can help someone down the road, or just be a look at what it takes to have a bot like we all take advantage of every day.

Also, I am not going to be supporting this... this is simply an informational peace and to cement a moment in time when I turned this bot off after about a year of work.
